#### Typecasting 
The process of converting one data type to another

**Implicit conversion** - if data types are compatible, automatic
*ex)* when Python runs operations involving integers and floats, it implicitly converts integer types intoo floats, then completes the operation.

However, while Python's implicit type conversion works when using the + operator between strings and integers, it does not work between strings and floats.

**Loop**

continue vs pass - pass will still make the rest of the loop AFTER the pass run before the next iteration. continue will stop that iteration right there and move onto the next iteration immediately.
